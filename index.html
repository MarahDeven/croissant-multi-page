    <p>
      Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
      crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity.[4] Croissants have long
      been a staple of Austrian, Italian, and French bakeries and pâtisseries.
      The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century. In the late
      1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked
      dough made them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by unskilled
      labor.
