      Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
      crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity. Croissants have long been
      a staple of Austrian, Italian, and French bakeries and p√¢tisseries. The
      modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century. In the late
      1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked
      dough made them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by unskilled
      labor.
